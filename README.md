# The Leopold

This is the second in a series of videos on the Eudaimonia Machine. This one is about The Leopold, a Eudaimonia Machine that was planned for construction but ultimately was never built. The plans for the machine, however, provide a look into the evolution of the machine's layout and design philosophy.
